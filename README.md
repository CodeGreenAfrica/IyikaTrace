# IyikaTrace
IyikaTrace is a digital platform built to track, trace, and verify the journey of agricultural products from the point of harvest to the end consumer â€” locally and internationally. Designed for transparency, compliance, and food safety, it will serve farmers, processors, exporters, and regulators.
