# IyikaTrace
# 1. Summary
IyikaTrace is a digital platform built to track, trace, and verify the journey of agricultural products from the point of harvest to the end consumer — locally and internationally. Designed for transparency, compliance, and food safety, it will serve farmers, processors, exporters, and regulators.
By assigning unique trace IDs to produce batches and collecting data at each supply chain checkpoint, the platform empowers stakeholders with end-to-end visibility of product origin, handling, and compliance status.

# 2. Objectives
Digitally trace agricultural produce across all stages: production, aggregation, transportation, processing, warehousing, retail/export, and consumption
Ensure compliance with local and international standards, including EU, US, and Gulf markets
Create trust and transparency in agricultural value chains
Enable real-time verification by consumers, regulators, and off-takers
Offer custom traceability reports for exporters and agribusinesses
